Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability.

Task 
Bag1 contains 4 red balls and 5 black balls. 
Bag2 contains 3 red balls and 7 black balls. 
One ball is drawn from the Bag1, and 2 balls are drawn from Bag2. Find the probability that 2 balls are black and 1 ball is red.

Output Format

In the editor below, submit your answer as Plain Text in the form of an irreducible fraction , where  and are both integers.

Your answer should resemble something like:

RBB: 4/9 * 7/10 * 6/9 = 56/270
BRB: 5/9 * 3/10 * 7/9 = 35/270
BBR: 5/9 * 7/10 * 3/9 = 35/270

126/270 = 42/90 = 7/15
