Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating standard deviation.

Task 
The heights of a group of children are measured. The resulting data has a mean of  0.675 meters, and a standard deviation of 0.065 meters. One particular child is 90.25 centimeters tall. Compute z, the number of standard deviations away from the mean that the particular child is.

Enter the value of , correct to a scale of two decimal places.

Output Format

Your output must be a floating point/decimal number, correct to a scale of  decimal places. You can submit solutions in either of the  following ways:
