Task 
Bag X contains 5 white balls and 4 black balls. Bag Y contains 7 white balls and 6 black balls. You draw 1 ball from bag X and, without observing its color, put it into bag Y. Now, if a ball is drawn from bag , find the probability that it is black.

Output Format

In the editor below, submit your answer as Plain Text in the form of an irreducible fraction , where  and are both integers.

Your answer should resemble something like:


WB
5/9 * 6/14= 30/126

BB
4/9 * 7/14 = 28/126

58/126 = 29/63
