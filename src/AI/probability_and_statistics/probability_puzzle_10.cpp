Bill and Nina appear for an interview for two vacancies. The probability of Bill’s selection is 1/3 and that of Nina’s selection is 1/5. Find the probability that only one of them will be selected.

Fill in the answer in the text box, in the form of an irreducible fraction A/B where A and B are two integers.

e.g. Your answer should resemble something like:
1/3*4/5 + 2/3*1/5 = 4+2/15 = 2/5
