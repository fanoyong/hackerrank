Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability.

Task 
There are  urns: ,  and .

Urn X contains  4 red balls and 3 black balls.
Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
Urn Z    contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.
One ball is drawn from each urn. What is the probability that the 3 balls drawn consist of 2 red balls and 1 black ball?


Output Format

In the editor below, submit your answer as Plain Text in the form of an irreducible fraction , where  and are both integers.

Your answer should resemble something like:

XY: 4/7 * 5/9 * 4/8
YZ: 5/9 * 4/8 * 3/7
ZX: 4/7 * 4/8 * 4/9

= 4/8(20/63 + 15/63 + 16/63) = (51/126) = 17/42
